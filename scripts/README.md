# Operational scripts

The supported scripts run through Make so local endpoints and database values
can live in one ignored `.env.scripts` file.

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.scripts.example .env.scripts
```

Edit the local file as needed. Make exports its values before invoking a
script, so they take precedence over values loaded from the application's
`.env` files. To use another file, pass `SCRIPTS_ENV=/path/to/file`.

## Context-budget measurement

This asks the local Ollama API for exact prompt token counts. It can optionally
read tags from the running application and sample receipt image paths from
PostgreSQL.

```bash
make script-context-budget ARGS="--model glm-ocr:latest"
make script-context-budget ARGS="--model glm-ocr:latest --image tests/data/lidl.jpg"
make script-context-budget ARGS="--model glm-ocr:latest --db-sample 24"
```

The command sends image content to the configured `OLLAMA_HOST`. Keep that URL
pointing at the local Ollama instance to preserve Vision Bill's privacy model.

## Create a benchmark run

The API must be running, the account must be an admin, and selected receipt IDs
must be UUIDs for verified receipts. Put `VB_USERNAME` and `VB_PASSWORD` in the
ignored `.env.scripts`, or pass them as arguments.

```bash
make script-create-benchmark ARGS="--model glm-ocr:latest --limit 10"
make script-create-benchmark ARGS="--receipt-id 125b2a52-60ac-4e1f-b9bf-d223f15c8cd1"
```

## PostgreSQL roles

Use three kinds of database identity in a deployed installation:

- An owner/migration login runs Alembic and owns schema objects. Do not use it
  for the application process.
- A runtime login belongs to the `vision_bill_runtime` group. It can read and
  modify application rows, but cannot create or alter schema objects.
- A reporting login belongs to `vision_bill_readonly`. Use this for ad-hoc
  analysis and scripts that only query data.

The application itself cannot use the read-only role: uploads, receipt review,
user authentication, and benchmark processing all require writes. To create or
refresh the two privilege groups, set `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` to the owner
connection and run:

```bash
make db-configure-roles
```

Create login roles with strong passwords separately, then grant exactly one
group to each login:

```sql
CREATE ROLE vision_bill_app LOGIN PASSWORD 'replace-me';
GRANT vision_bill_runtime TO vision_bill_app;

CREATE ROLE vision_bill_reports LOGIN PASSWORD 'replace-me';
GRANT vision_bill_readonly TO vision_bill_reports;
ALTER ROLE vision_bill_reports SET default_transaction_read_only = on;
ALTER ROLE vision_bill_reports SET statement_timeout = '5s';
```

Do not make either login a table owner or superuser: owners bypass ordinary
table grants. `configure_db_roles.sql` must run as the same owner Alembic uses,
because PostgreSQL default privileges are scoped to the object-creating role.

## Prototype files

`run_functional_tests.py`, `llm_benchmark_runner.py`, `single_image.py`, and
`test_external_api.py` are historical placeholders with hard-coded or mock
behavior. They deliberately have no Make targets. Promote or remove each one
only after replacing its placeholder behavior; in particular, do not connect
`test_external_api.py` to receipt data because that would violate the local-only
inference constraint.
